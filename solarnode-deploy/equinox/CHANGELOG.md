# SolarNode Platform (Equinox) Changelog

## v20170306

**Note** if the Tyrus websocket server added in this release was deployed as
a normal application artifact (e.g. in `app/main`), that copy should be removed
after upgrading to this version so there aren't two copies loaded.
 
 * Update to Gemini Web 3.0 (Servlet 3.1)
 * Update to Spring 4.2.9
 * Add Tyrus websocket server.
