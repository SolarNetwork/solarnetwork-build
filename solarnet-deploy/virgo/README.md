Virgo 3.7 Deployment
====================

This build script is designed for deploying into the Virgo 3.7 server.
Run the **archive** task to create an archive of bundles suitable for
expanding in the root Virgo directory. You must create a 
`build.properties` file and an `ivy.xml` file in this directory to
specify which bundles and dependencies you want to include in the
server runtime. Copy the `example/build.properties` and 
`example/ivy.xml` file to this directory and use as a starting 
point.

Virgo can easily run into class loading deadlocks if you're not
careful with how the bundles are deployed. I've had success by
adding

	,repository:plan/net.solarnetwork.central.env.plan
	
to the `initialArtifacts` property in Virgo's 
`configuration/org.eclipse.virgo.kernel.userregion.properties` file
and then deploying the remaining plans via Virgo's `pickup` directory.
